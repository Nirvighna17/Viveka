# 🛡️ SafeScan — Food & Medicine Safety Scanner

SafeScan is an AI-powered Streamlit app that lets users scan product labels (food, beverage, medicine) and identifies potentially **harmful, warning, or prescription-only ingredients**.  
This project is inspired by the vision of creating a **health-conscious assistant** that ensures safety before consumption.
